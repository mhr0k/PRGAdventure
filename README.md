# RPGAdventure

This is a simple command prompt RPG Adventure game. It was created as a JavaScript OP learning project. You are a monkey and your goal is to reach the star. You will encounter enemies and loot on your way. The game requires node and Windows Terminal. Install node modules with 'npm install'. Run 'RPGAdventure.bat' to start. Can also run in VSCode integrated terminal (run "node Game.js"). Project idea from TechWithNader on Youtube.
